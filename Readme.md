# Spring Boot Security + JWT + RestAPI CRUD + JUNIT + MOCKITO

This project demontrates how to use JWT Token based Authentication. In this example we will save user authentication related data in database. The UserController has methods to get all users, create user, update user, get user by id,get user by email, search user by username and delete user. Basically, we have created rest api using DAO layer. 

In this example you will also find test cases for Service layer and Controller layer. We have used Junit and Mockito for testing. Test cases to access private and public API's are also written.
